# Discontinous Galerkin Method

This is is a project I did in University.  

The goals was to implement a simple Disconntious Galerkin solver in 1D for the acoustic wave equation in 1D:

$$
\begin{align}
	\rho \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{v}}{\partial t} + \nabla p =0         \\
	\frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\nabla p}{t} + \rho \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{v} =0 
\end{align}
$$

**NOTE:** Personally, I would never choose Matlab for any kind of prject. It's a terrible language. However, it was mandatory for this university project;
